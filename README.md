## 1. Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>
In the insurance industry, precise prediction of claim probabilities is vital for effective risk assessment and accurate policy pricing. However, a significant challenge arises from the frequent class imbalance in insurance claims datasets, where non-claim instances vastly outnumber actual claims. This imbalance complicates predictive modeling, leading to biased outcomes that favor the majority class and diminish the performance of models on the minority class. Addressing this issue is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of claims predictions, which are essential for better risk management and policy development.

## 2. Dataset <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>
The dataset utilized in this project comprises historical data on insurance claims, encompassing a variety of information about the policyholders, their demographics, past claim history, and other pertinent features. The dataset is structured to facilitate predictive modeling tasks aimed at accurately identifying the likelihood of future insurance claims. The data utilized in this exercise was obtained from Kaggle, under the dataset titled "Insurance Claim Analysis (Demographic and Health)". Access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/insurance-claim-analysis-demographic-and-health/data).
